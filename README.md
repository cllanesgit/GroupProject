Data Source

The data used in our project is collected from Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jackogozaly/data-science-and-stem-salaries?resource=download]. The Kaggle data itself, consists of 62,00 salary records from top companies. This data was scraped off levels.fyi .

This dataset consists of useful information such as education level. compensation (comprised of base salary, bonus, stock grants), race and more. It contains information from the US and other countries. The cleaning process included removing columns that are not necesary for our analysis as well as removing the lines that inlcude data not from the US.
